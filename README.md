This project is all about applying physics and mathematics in the web development through javascript and html5 canvas.

This project is generates random circles with beautiful colors throughout the page. They move in random directions and with random speeds.
When they hit the side of the browser window, the will change is direction just like Newton's Third law of motion phenomenon.
When we hover the size of the balls increases near the area of curser which gives this proect a great visual transition effect.
